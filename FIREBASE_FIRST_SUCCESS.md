# 🔥 Firebase-First User Management System

## Overview
Al Marya Rostery now follows **Firebase as the single source of truth** for all user data. MongoDB Users and Loyalty Accounts are automatically synchronized to match Firebase exactly.

## ✅ Current Sync Status
- **🔥 Firebase Users**: 7 (MASTER DATABASE)
- **📊 MongoDB Users**: 7 (100% synced)
- **🏆 Loyalty Accounts**: 7 (100% synced)

## 🎯 Firebase-First Architecture

### Firebase Auth (Master)
- **Purpose**: Primary authentication and user management
- **Contains**: User credentials, email verification, authentication tokens
- **Users**: 7 active users (3 real + 4 active guests)

### MongoDB Users Collection (Synced)
- **Purpose**: Local cache of Firebase user data for app functionality
- **Syncs**: Email, name, Firebase UID, verification status
- **Auto-updated**: When Firebase users change

### Loyalty Accounts (Synced)
- **Purpose**: Points, tiers, and rewards tracking
- **Linked**: Via Firebase UID and email
- **Auto-created**: When new Firebase users are added

## 🚀 Available Commands

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `npm run firebase:sync` | Full sync all systems to Firebase |
| `npm run firebase:validate` | Check sync health status |
