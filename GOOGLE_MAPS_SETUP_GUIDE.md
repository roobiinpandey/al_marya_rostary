- May show approximate location
- Google tries to find the address

- More accurate and reliable!

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Coordinate Format
- **Latitude**: First number (North/South position)
  - Range: -90 to 90
  - Dubai is around 25
  - Positive numbers = North of equator
  
- **Longitude**: Second number (East/West position)
  - Range: -180 to 180
  - Dubai is around 55
  - Positive numbers = East of prime meridian

### Common Mistakes
❌ **Wrong**: Putting both numbers in one field
❌ **Wrong**: Swapping latitude and longitude
❌ **Wrong**: Including the @ symbol or commas
✅ **Correct**: 25.0760 in Latitude, 55.1320 in Longitude

### Validation
The system will check:
- Latitude is between -90 and 90
- Longitude is between -180 and 180
- Both are valid numbers
- If validation fails, you'll see an error message

## 🔄 Fallback Behavior

The app is smart and has a fallback:
- **If coordinates are provided**: Uses exact GPS coordinates ✅
- **If coordinates are empty**: Uses text address for search
- Both methods work, but coordinates are more accurate!
