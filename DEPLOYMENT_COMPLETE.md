## 🚀 What Happens in Production

### When Users Run This APK:

**Debug Logging (ALL REMOVED)**:
```dart
// This code exists in source:
AppLogger.debug('Widget state: $state');
AppLogger.info('Loading products...');
AppLogger.network('API call made');

// In production APK: COMPLETELY REMOVED by compiler
// Result: Zero performance impact, zero log output
```

**Error Logging (KEPT)**:
```dart
// This code exists and runs:
AppLogger.error('Failed to load', error: e);
AppLogger.warning('Cache expired');

// In production: Shows errors for debugging crashes
// User never sees these - only in crash reports
```

**User Experience**:
- Fast app startup (no logging overhead)
- Smaller APK size (debug code removed)
- Better battery life (no print processing)
- Professional quality
