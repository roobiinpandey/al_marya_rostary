## ⚡ Quick Fix (3 Steps)

### Step 1: Download Fresh Key
1. Go to: https://console.firebase.google.com/
2. Select project: **qahwat-al-emarat**
3. Click ⚙️ → **Project Settings** → **Service Accounts**
4. Click **Generate New Private Key** → Download

### Step 2: Format the Key
```bash
cd "/Volumes/PERSONAL/Al Marya Rostery APP/al_marya_rostery/backend/scripts"
node format-firebase-key.js ~/Downloads/your-key-file.json
```

**Copy the output** (the single-line JSON between the dashed lines)

### Step 3: Update Render
1. Go to: https://dashboard.render.com/
2. Open: **al-marya-rostary** service
3. Click: **Environment** tab
4. Find: `FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY`
5. Click Edit → **Delete old value**
6. **Paste new value** from Step 2
7. Click **Save Changes**

✅ Render will auto-redeploy (wait 2-3 minutes)

## ✅ How to Verify It Worked

Check Render logs after deployment. You should see:

**SUCCESS:**
```
✅ Firebase Admin SDK initialized successfully
✅ Firebase User Sync Service initialized
🚀 Starting Auto Firebase Sync Service...
```

**STILL FAILING:**
- Make sure you copied the ENTIRE JSON string
- Ensure NO line breaks in the value
- Try the Secret File method instead (see below)

---

## 🔐 Alternative: Use Secret File (More Reliable)

If environment variable keeps failing:

1. Render Dashboard → **al-marya-rostary** → **Environment**
2. Scroll to **Secret Files** section
3. Click **Add Secret File**
4. Set:
   - **Filename**: `/etc/secrets/firebase-service-account.json`
   - **Contents**: Paste your multi-line JSON (from Firebase Console)
5. Click **Save**

The code will automatically use the secret file!
